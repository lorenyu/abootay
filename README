Random tips:


1. To create a new Django project on your laptop, cd into the directory you want to have your files live in. Then run django-admin.py startproject abootay. Ive set this up so this is different from my git repository, and I'll just copy files from one to the othe
2. To start the development server on your laptop, run python manage.py runserver. Now, from your laptop's browser if you go to http://localhost/<yoursitefullpath> you should see your django stuff.
3. To create a new subdirectory under abootay ( in Django terms, an 'app' ) run python manage.py startapp <app>. I've done one for helloWorld.
